FILE: billing_alarm_sample.yaml
PURPOSE: An example of a Cloudformation template that could be used to create a CloudWatch billing alarm. 
NOTES: Probably silly to create a stack with just this resource. Would be better served as part of a larger template
The Parameters can be stored/managed from a separate JSON file like an CFN template
